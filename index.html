      <p><strong># Welcome to Team B Bug Tracker System Project!</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>Here is a summary of the system requirements and high level design flow:</p>

<p>The Bug Tracker System contains four screens:</p>

<p>• A screen that allows for the submitting of a new ticket,
• A confirmation screen that is displayed upon the successful submission of a
ticket,
• A screen that shows a list of open tickets against an existing application, and
• A screen that shows the details of a single ticket.</p>

<p>The system provides several features:</p>

<p>• The ability to submit a defect against an application, which includes a status, priority, assignee, summary, and detailed description,
• The ability to update an existing defect,
• The ability to assign a defect request to a person,
• The ability to email status information to a user, and
• The ability to view a list of all open defects.</p>

<p>The system is available via the Internet with a user-friendly interface. </p>

<p>There are several business rules:</p>

<p>• An application must exist before a defect can be submitted against it.
• Each defect submitted must have a unique identifier.
• A ticket cannot be submitted against a closed application.</p>
